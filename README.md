The entire codebase is designed to connect to two vibration sensors via an RS485 port 
using the Modbus protocol in Node.js, find the fastest reliable polling rate to request data from them without errors, 
and then continuously collect and log their vibration readings at that optimized rate in a steady, error-free loop.
